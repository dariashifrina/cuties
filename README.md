# Cuties Computer Vision
## James Smith, Daria Shifrina, Gilvir Gill
Cuties Computer Vision (**CCV**) is a basic implementation of [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), the idea of using a computer to interpret visual data. In this case, it relies simply on keeping track of a single object via it's color,shape, and other characteristics. We use the built in Processing Video library, which is based off of and requires locally gstreamer. 

To run the CCV program, simply use `processing CCV/CCV.pde` and select whether you want to use an active camera feed, or a video.

Have fun, thinkers!
