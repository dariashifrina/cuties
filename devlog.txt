/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...
-Got a camera feed working!(Figured out how the Video library worked, even with its lack of good documentation)
-Handled multithreading in file selection(set a state variable that would wait in the menu until the stream was running)
-Got mirroring to work(Swapped pixels to their opposite positions horizontally assuming the y axis divides the screen in the middle)
-Fixed the program constantly crashing due to resizing errors(set the window to have a default and a image dimension resize if available)
-got object tracking working after many failed methods(Thought of using HSB as opposed to color distance(RGB) or edge detection because of their undesirable results)
- Got multiview frame filtering working in a cohesive manner(handled filtering frames by using 3 color arrays to represent one frame, one that is unedited, one that is for the tracked object, and one for intermediate filtering steps)

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File selection is not restricted to video file formats!
There is no restriction on picking "Camera" if you don't have a camera
The matrix traversal is very slow because we kept getting stack overflow errors if we tried to use any form of recursion on the screen.
Resizing may fail on computers due to how GStreamer initializes the video feed
The sobel filter is VERY slow
There is still a considerable amount of noise(tracked pixels that shouldnt) even after filtering

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The advantages and disadvantages of color systems
How kernel based filtering works
Matrix approximated derivatives
How gaussian blur filters, erosion, dilation, and sobel filters work and their runtimes

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- realized Camera has a 1D array attribute instead of a 3D array. Pixels aren't divided into two arrays of rows and cols but instead, a 1D array holds colors(Not a big hiccup, made everything more practical and made some math function for the convenience of 2d coordinates)
- Abstracted video feed to an interface implemented by video file and web cam(Realized that this was really nice to have to make the driver file cleaner)
- Switched to use edge tracking(RGB distance provided too much noise, so we hope to use edge detection to contain the object)
- Scratch that^ it failed...Swapped to a binary double threshold filter for HSB color(edge detection was not performing well enough speed wise nor result wise to be a viable tracking method. HSB provides the pros of RGB but with less downsides after filtering)

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tales of wisdom gained...
Driver operator is sooooooo useful when you are working on complex problems
The recursion stack limit is far too small to use for outwards expansion traversal in a large matrix
Don't hard code too many things, because you may have to restructure and it will be painful to do...
Don't become too focused on one problem when you have many other things to worry about that have a higher priority.
You must be concious of efficiency at all times, especially in a program that is very demanding on hardware(For example, we couldn't use a Gaussian blur in our main tracking algorithm because of how expensive it was, though it would have provided better results. You can physically see poor performance through bad framerates)

==============================================================

2017-05-17
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: Wrote project proposal
==============================================================

2017-05-18
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: Revised proposal
==============================================================

2017-05-22
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: Created plan for CCV
==============================================================

2017-05-23
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: Created UML diagram of CCV and flowcharts for CCV driver class and trackedObject
==============================================================

2017-05-25
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gilvir: Got a live camera feed to be displayed
Dasha and James: ironed out the final structure for TrackedObject and began coding its constructor.
James, Gilvir, Dasha: realized Camera has a 2D array attribute instead of a 3D array. Pixels aren't divided into two arrays of rows and cols but instead, a 1D array holds all of the pixels.
==============================================================

2017-05-26
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: Continued to write the framework for the program. We are almost finished with the main code that allows the classes to interact. We now hope to finish the framework by tomorrow and begin getting our hands dirty in the nitty gritty :)
==============================================================


2017-05-27
--------------------------------------------------------------
James: Set up class for video file stream, restructured video feeds, and wrote the code for the user menu to select webcam vs video file feed.
Gilvir: Added a few methods to Frame such as setColor() swapColor() for ease of use, implemented mirroring to simulate what people expect/demonstrate how to manipulate the image
==============================================================

2017-05-30
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gilvir: Attempted to implement most primative version of TrackedObject, which relies on recursively telling each pixel to call it's fellow pixels. However, this caused a StackOverFlow error,and so the entire method needs to be reevaluated. 
James: Revised flowchart and UML diagrams.

2017-06-01
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: changed approach to tracking edges instead of using color. We're going to use color to find an object's pixel, then use edge filtering to navigate the edges of the object.
James: Created the outward traversal algorithm, continued working on the TrackedObject class, cleaned up code, and put the repo in compliance with the homeworks(I didn't realize that we had to make new files for the plan)
==============================================================

2017-06-02
--------------------------------------------------------------
James: continued coding the traversal and cleaned up code.
Dasha: added slider to adjust threshold. 
==============================================================

2017-06-03
--------------------------------------------------------------
James: Completed a custom sobel edge detection filter. Turned out to be too inconsistent to be used in tracking, but we are going to keep it as a feature in the program and to possibly use in motion detection if we get to it!
==============================================================

2017-06-04
--------------------------------------------------------------
James: Since sobel edge detection wasnt reliable, I wrote a double threshold HSB filter. Debugged the program, added buttons, cleaned up code.
Dasha: Worked on flowcharts and UML for the final product.
==============================================================

2017-06-05
--------------------------------------------------------------
James: Writing the README to look nice and to explain everything comprehensively. 
Dasha: updated usermenu.
==============================================================

2017-06-06
--------------------------------------------------------------
James, Gilvir, Dasha: fixed resizing issue.
James: Finished up README and updated devlog
==============================================================
