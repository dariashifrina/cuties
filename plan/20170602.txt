Plan: 06/01/17
=====================
Which jobs are most crucial?
Developing an algo for traversing a matrix outwards from a single point
Edge filtering
TrackedObject Constructor
Developing an algorithm for navigating an edge
Getting the trackedObject class to work
Calibration mode to adjust threshold and swap between mirrored frames, and edge filter display(also works as program debugger)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^MVP^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
Tracking off screen
Line tracing motion
Multiple object tracking
Optical Character Recognition(OCR)
--------------------------
Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
The Camera, Video, Frame, and TrackedObject classes are all essential, as well as a basic CCV driver that outputs the camera and marks the object in a basic way are all essential.
Tracking multiple objects of the same type also constitutes core function, since only tracking 1 would lead to inconsistent behavior from the perspective of the user depending on how we implement the tracking/searching (it would essentially be non-safe and could randomly jump object).
--------------------------
Which components are prerequisites for others?Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
--------------------------
The algo for outwards matrix traversal from a single point  needs to be done before any work on the tracked object can begin(can be delegated)
Edge detection filtering is necessary to know when to stop/start your matrix traversal(can be delegated)
Everything past the MVP can be done at any time, though tracking off screen should most likely be done before multi object tracking.
